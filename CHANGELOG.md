# Changelog

Notable changes in each release.

## [Unreleased]
- Fix startup crash when `profile.xml` is corrupted ([#59](https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/pull/59)).
- Fix startup crash of Warhead launcher when Logitech Gaming Software is installed
([#39](https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/issues/39)).
- Improve crash logger ([#53](https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/pull/53),
[#55](https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/pull/55)).

## [v6] - 2024-02-15
### Added
- Crysis Editor (Sandbox 2) support.
- Crysis Warhead support (64-bit only).
- Crysis Wars executable with correct icon. No other differences. All executables always support all game variants.
- DX10 renderer now supports [overriding d3d10.dll and dxgi.dll](https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/issues/34)
by placing them into the same directory.
- `-userpath` to change user directory path.
- `-userdirname` to change name of user directory in `Documents/My Games/`.
- Mods can now request their own user directory in `Documents/My Games/` by exporting `GetUserDirName` function:
```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) const char* GetUserDirName()
{
    return "My Mod";  // -> "Documents/My Games/My Mod"
}
```
- Path information in the log:
```
Main directory: C:\Crysis
Root directory: C:\Crysis
User directory: C:\Users\User\Documents\My Games\Crysis
```
### Fixed
- Fixed [the two broken panels in Editor](https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/pull/38).
- Fixed incorrectly trimmed spaces from CPU model name in specific cases.
- Fixed rare crash in the engine due to out-of-bounds access of the `CPUInfo::cores` array.

### Changed
- Each game variant now has its own release ZIP with all available executables:
    - `c1-launcher-v6-build.zip` => Crysis => game + dedicated server + headless server + editor
    - `c1-launcher-v6-build-wars.zip` => Crysis Wars => game + dedicated server + headless server + editor
    - `c1-launcher-v6-build-warhead.zip` => Crysis Warhead => game (64-bit)
        - Both dedicated and headless server launchers also support Crysis Warhead, which is singleplayer-only and has
no server launcher by default. However, it ships without CryRenderNULL DLL, so both server launchers fail to start the
engine there.

## [v5] - 2023-11-03
### Added
- GPU information in the log:
```
Renderer initialization
D3D10 Adapter: AMD Radeon RX 480 Graphics (RADV POLARIS10)
D3D10 Adapter: PCI 1002:67df (rev 00)
D3D10 Adapter: Dedicated video memory = 8G
